## FinalProject
#### Final project by Ryan Rottmann, Kyle Rosswick, and Perry Smith


This project is designed to put file types into a table and automatically detect what file type it is.  Upon detection, this application will sort the items based off of type. This will make organizing your documents easy and give users a new way to keep track of their documents.
